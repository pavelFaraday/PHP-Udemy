`isset()`, `unset()` - The isset() function is an inbuilt function in PHP which checks whether a variable is set (not empty) and is not NULL. This function also checks if a declared variable, array or array key has null value, if it does, isset() returns false, it returns true in all other possible cases. Determine if a variable is considered set, this means if a variable is declared and is different than null. If a variable has been unset with the unset() function, it is no longer considered to be set.
